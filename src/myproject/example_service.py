"""Canonical service pattern. Copy this shape for new services.

Demonstrates:
- Pydantic boundary model with `extra="forbid", frozen=True` so upstream
  shape drift fails loudly. (For external APIs you don't control, see
  AGENTS.md "Appropriate divergence — Profile B (scraping)" — `extra="ignore"`
  is correct there.)
- Dependency injection of the httpx client — testable, no hidden globals.
- Domain errors raised at every boundary; httpx and pydantic exceptions
  never leak to callers.
- structlog for structured logging.
